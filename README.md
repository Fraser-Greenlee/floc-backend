This is the source code for a Messenger bot I made named Floc.

Floc was an anonymous location based Messenger Bot that let you chat and share jokes with others nearby.

## Product Info

* User base organically grew to have over a thousand messages on the largest chat that lasted the life of the startup.
* Modified the app according to user feedback.
* Built a Flask backend using a Postgres database with both hosted on Heroku.
* Developed a local Messenger server that allowed tests with fake users to be written to check the bots responses.
* Used Test-driven development to ensure updates were successful.

Unfortunately as the bot grew to people outside of my friend-group the original humour was lost and since we had exams and then I had a summer internship I decided to close the project.

If I re-open the project I would either:
* Advertise it as a game where any group of friends can really quickly setup an anonymous chat and start messaging! Maybe you could integrate that into a game?
* Make the messages act more like posts on a Facebook feed using the a 👍/👎 to vote on a message and having them send out to more and more people as they get more votes.
